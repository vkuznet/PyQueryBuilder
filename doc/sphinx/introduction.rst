PyQB stands for Python Query Builder System. It is a general
system providing a keyword search query interface over any
relational databases. This interface is named as PyQB Query Language,
which sources from DBS discovery system on [CMS]_ High Energy
Physics experiment at [LHC]_, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland.
It supports all major DBMSs including Oracle, MySQL, DB2,
PostgreSQL, SQLServer, SQLite. It is written in [Python]_, thereby can be
deployed on different Operating Systems.
