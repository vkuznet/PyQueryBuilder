Introduction:
-------------

The PyQueryBuilder is a project to build SQL queries out of provided
Query Language (QL) expresions. This project has been started within
CMS High-Energy Physics collaboration (CERN, Geneva, Switzerland) to 
provide access to CMS Data Bookkeeping System. It was used as general
purpose Data Discovery service. 

We decided to take it apart from CMS infrastructure and create a
general purpose QL builder with intention to be transparent to DB back-end
and underlying schema implementation.

For more information about it please refer to the following paper:
